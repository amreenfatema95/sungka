#INTRODUCTION
Hailing from the Philippines, Sungka is a two-player turn based game that dates back to around BC 1400 and is thought to be one of the oldest games in the world. This game is played on a long and narrow board carved from wood and consists of 16 trays; 7 small trays and one large tray(known as a store) for each player. The aim of the game is to capture as many shells as possible and collect them in the player’s store.

#USAGE
The application can be initiated using any real Android device. Currently, the leader-board does not work using emulators, as I am under the impression that emulators do not necessarily support SQL Lite databases; which is being used to record the stats.
Steps to run the game on an Android Device:

   *  Import the game in Android studio

   *     Connect the Android device to the PC on which the game has been     imported

   *     Enable the Developer options on the Android device. This is   generally done as follows:

   * On Android 4.2 and newer, Developer options is hidden by default. To make it available, go to Settings > About phone and tap Build number seven times.

    * Return to the previous screen to find Developer options.

    *  Navigate to the Developer Options within the settings on the Android device.

* Check the USB Debugging Option

    *  Run the application through Android studio

    *  Select the launch device, as the Android device being used - Enjoy the launched game!!!
